	This IA Redesign of <a href="http://louisiana.edu">University of Louisiana, Lafayette</a> is by <strong>Marian Wang, Sharon Hwang, Michael Yamane</strong>. </div>

	<h1>Personas and Scenarios</h1>

	<div class="stuff">
We created 5 different personas, giving them 3 scenarios each using the current UL website.

	Due to the multitude of tables we have for our competitive analysis, it can be seen on another page here:

	<h1>Design Choices</h1>
	</div>
	<div class="stuff">
		For our design, we decided to not use the beige that's on the original page as a background. Instead we opted for a grey background and the area where the main part site sits is white. With white, we are able to use box shadows to create a nice shadow effect for each of the boxes we put on there. Ultimately, we decided to go with a choice of colors that contained primarily of shades of grey, black, and red. While creating the layout, it was a difficult choice on how we should implement the "vermillion" into our design. Vermillion is one of UL's school colors (source: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Louisiana_at_Lafayette">Wikipedia</a>) and falls into the category of being a red-orange color. By being so bright, it would immediately clash with much of our other muted colors. Eventually, it was decided that we opt for a shade of red that's a few shades darker than vermillion, but still within it's hue range. Using a website called <a href="http://0to255.com">0to255</a> we found a red that fit very well with the rest of our redesign's color and chose to use that red instead. We did manage to incorporate vermillion into the redesign though, when you hover over a link the color that you see is vermillion.</div>
<div class="stuff">
Two of the sites that were a big inspiration were Harvard's website (<a href="http://harvard.edu">http://harvard.edu</a>) and UCSD's website (<a href="http://ucsd.edu">http://ucsd.edu</a>). Harvard's website gave us the idea to use a red border at the top in order to incorporate the red into our design. Harvard's usage of multiple boxes to categorize and show information was also a big influence. For UCSD, their TritonLink button was a big inspiration. Since UCSD has their TritonLink button stand out so much from the rest of navigation bar, it gave us the idea to make the U-Link button stand out too on our design. However, instead of overlaying an image like UCSD did, we just changed the font to red.

	<h1>Hardest Design Decisions</h1>
	</div>
	<div class="stuff">
	
Throughout this redesign we were faced with many difficult decisions concerning the best ways to make this site user friendly. Many decisions were made based off of competitive analysis and user scenarios. It was difficult to decide where would arrange headings, the color schemes, and how to categorize large amounts of information in a clear and concise manner.</div>
<div class="stuff">
For example, it was hard to decide where we would put the “customized experience” tabs (students, parents & visitors, faculty & staff, and alumni) and how much importance these tabs would have. Based on our thoughts we decided that this was a very important group to cater to, thusly the customized experience tabs were placed in the center of the main page. Each group was given a separate box for easier viewing and to maximize whitespace to help the flow of the page. </div>

<div class="stuff">
In addition, it was difficult in agreeing upon links would go underneath the main navigation headings. We wanted as few links as possible, while still being efficient in conveying enough information. In regards to our homepage as a whole, it was hard to choose between a news section and an image slider. We decided to use the image slider to increase visual stimulation and though that the use of pictures would break up the text.</div>

<div class="stuff">Furthermore, another difficult decision was agreeing upon the color scheme. We knew from the beginning that we wanted to include red & white, but not how to use these two colors without looking tacky and illegible. In many cases white font is hard to read so we went with white only on the main navigation, which incorporated a grey background. For the rest of the site we used red or black font on a white or grey background.</div>

<div class="stuff">
In conclusion, we used various strategies and techniques to help us make our most difficult decisions. We decided as a group that in terms of site design, the simpler the better and the easiest site to navigate through would be the superior site for the user.</div>

	<h1>Website Redesign Index</h1>
	</div>
	<div class="stuff">
	For our website, we didn't redesign every single main page that was linked from the navigation bar. <strong>The following index shows which pages have been redesigned. Any pages that are not linked in this index, but have a clickable link on the redesigned site will either lead to a page from the original page or just be an empty hot link.</strong> When any of the items on the navigation menu are clicked, a drop-down menu appears- therefore the navigation links <strong>do not</strong> directly link to anything.
